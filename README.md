# Long-Term Tilt Testing Device for Pedometer Boards
This project is a long-term testing system for pedometer electronic boards, focusing specifically on tilt sensor durability and motion simulation. Using an ESP32 microcontroller and large servo motors, multiple pedometer boards are moved over extended periods to simulate real-world usage conditions.

## Features
### Multiple Board Testing:

Supports testing of several pedometer boards simultaneously.

### Continuous Motion Simulation:

Uses large servo motors to perform repetitive tilt movements over long periods.

### ESP32-Based Control:

Handles servo motor movements and timing precisely.

### Durability and Lifetime Testing:

Designed for endurance tests that last for hours, days, or even weeks.

### Scalable Setup:

Easily adaptable to increase the number of boards or modify movement patterns.

## Hardware Used
ESP32 Development Board

High Torque Servo Motors

Mounting Fixtures for Pedometer Boards

## Project Overview
The system is developed to:

Simulate real-world tilt and movement conditions for pedometer boards.

Identify failures, degradation, or anomalies in tilt sensors over time.

Help manufacturers improve the reliability and lifespan of their products.

The device provides a controlled, repeatable, and automated environment for extended mechanical testing, significantly reducing the need for manual handling.

## Future Improvements
Adding wireless monitoring and logging of test status.

Integrating load cells or additional sensors to simulate more complex movement patterns.

Real-time data collection and cloud upload features.
